# Introduction 

This folder contains the source code (i.e., .py files) used in the paper “ALSO-X is Better Than CVaR: Convex Approximations for Chance Constrained
Programs Revisited” The paper proposed two algorithms, termed "ALSO-X" and "ALSO-X+", to solve CCPs and DRCCPs, correspodning to subfolders Experiment 1-2 and subfolders Experiment 3-4. To successfully run the code in subfolders, you may need to install Python (i.e. .py files) and Matlab (i.e. .m files).
Below is the detailed explanation of each subfolder.

# Subfolder: Experiment 1
**Testing in CCPs.**
--Purpose:
--Source code info:


# Subfolder: Experiment 2
**Comparisions in Covering CCPs.**


# Subfolder: Experiment 3
**Testing in DRCCPs.**



# Subfolder: Experiment 4
**Illustration Example in a DRCCP with Gaussian reference distirbution.**




Feel free to refer to the codes displayed in the subfolders. If used in your research, please cite our paper.
